    <h1>Rudyard Kipling</h1>
    <h4>English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist (1865-1936)</h4>

    <p>
        Joseph Rudyard Kipling (/ˈrʌdjərd/ RUD-yərd; 30 December 1865 – 18 January 1936) was an English journalist, 
        short-story writer, poet, and novelist. He was born in India, which inspired much of his work.
        Kipling's works of fiction include 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book">The Jungle Book </a> 
        (1894),
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_(novel)">Kim</a>
        (1901), and many short stories, including "The Man Who Would Be King" (1888). 
        <br>
        His poems include "Mandalay" (1890), "Gunga Din" (1890), 
        "The Gods of the Copybook Headings" (1919), "The White Man's Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands" (1899), 
        and "If—" (1910). He is seen as an innovator in the art of the short story. His children's books are classics; one critic noted "a versatile and luminous narrative gift".

        Kipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdom's most popular writers.
        Henry James said "Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius, as distinct from fine intelligence,
        that I have ever known." In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, 
        as the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and at 41, 
        its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood, but declined both.
        Following his death in 1936, his ashes were interred at Poets' Corner, part of the South Transept of Westminster Abbey.

    If you can keep your head when all about you   
        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
        But make allowance for their doubting too;   
    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
        Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
    Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
        And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

    If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
        If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
        And treat those two impostors just the same;   
    If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
        Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
        And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

    If you can make one heap of all your winnings
        And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings
        And never breathe a word about your loss;
    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
        To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
    And so hold on when there is nothing in you
        Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
        Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
        If all men count with you, but none too much;
    If you can fill the unforgiving minute
        With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
    Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
        And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
